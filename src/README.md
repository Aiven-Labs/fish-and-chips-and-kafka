# Demo code for "Fish and Chips and Apache Kafka速"

## What we have here

Two "proof of concept" programs:

* [`poc1_use_kafka.py`](poc1_use_kafka.py) - checking we can send to and
  receive from a Kafka service
* [`poc2_textual.py`](poc2_textual.py) - showing the basics of the Textual UI
  we shall use in the demonstrations

Some support code:

* [`demo_helpers.py`](demo_helpers.py) - used in the PoCs and in the demo programs.

The demonstrations discussed in the talk:

* [`demo1_cod_and_chips.py`](demo1_cod_and_chips.py)- a till sending orders to
  a topic, and a food preparer consuming them.

* [`demo2_cod_and_chips_3tills.py`](demo2_cod_and_chips_3till.py)- three
  tills, but still only one preparer, who can't keep up.

* [`demo3_cod_and_chips_3till_2preparers.py`](demo3_cod_and_chips_3tills_2preparers.py) -
  three tills and two preparers, who can keep up.

* [`demo4_with_cook.py`](demo4_with_cook.py) - back to one till and one food
  preparer, but now we have a cook to prepare plaice for us.

## Set up

### Python version

The `poc2_textual.py` program required Python 3.11, so it can use
[`asyncio
TaskGroups`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#task-groups)
to organise its asynchronous tasks - they're much nicer than previous ways of
doing this.

The other demo programs should work with Python 3.10.

### Install Python libraries

Make sure you're in this directory:
```shell
cd src
```

Create Python virtual environment
```shell
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the necessary Python packages, using the `requirements.txt` file:
```shell
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can install the specific requirements:
```shell
pip install textual aiokafka kafka-python click aiven-client
```

## How to run the demos with Aiven

You don't need to run the demos using Aiven services, but I think it's
the easiest option if you don't already have Kafka up and running.

### Get an account

If you don't yet have an Aiven account, you can [sign up for a free
trial](https://console.aiven.io/signup/email)

### Log in to Aiven

Get an authentication token, as described at [Create an authentication
token](https://docs.aiven.io/docs/platform/howto/create_authentication_token.html),
copy it, and log in using the following command. You'll need to replace
YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS with the email address you've registered with Aiven:

``` shell
avn user login YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS --token
```

This will prompt you to paste in your token.

### Choose a project, cloud and service plan

Aiven uses "projects" to organise which services you can access. You can
list them with:

``` shell
avn project list
```

Choose the project you want to use with the following command, replacing
`PROJECT_NAME` with the appropriate name:

``` shell
avn project switch PROJECT_NAME
```

You then need to decide what cloud you want to run the service in. Use:

``` shell
avn cloud list
```

to find the clouds. Since Aiven is based out of Helsinki, I tend to
choose `google-europe-north1`, which is Finland, but you'll want to make
your own choice.

Normally, you'd also want to decide on a service plan (which determines
the number of servers, the memory, CPU and disk resources for the
service). You can find the service plans for a cloud using:

``` shell
avn service plans --service-type kafka --cloud CLOUD_NAME
```

However, for the these demo programs a `kafka:startup-2` plan is
sufficient, and that's also the cheapest.

### Create a Kafka service

Now it's time to create the actual Kafka service, using the command
below.

The service name needs to be unique and can't be changed - I like to put
my name in it (for instance, `tibs-kafka-fish`).

It's useful to set an environment variable for the service name - so in Bash
you'd do:
```shell
export KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME=tibs-kafka-fish
```
and if you're using the [Fish shell](https://fishshell.com/) (like me) you'd do:
```shell
set -x KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME tibs-kafka-fish
```

The extra `-c` switches enable the REST API to the service (used to get
some of the information available in the web console), the ability to
create new topics by publishing to them (we definitely want this), and
use of the schema registry (which we actually don't need in this demo,
but it doesn't cost extra and is often useful).

Again, remember to replace the cloud name with the one you actually want:

``` shell
avn service create $KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME \
    --service-type kafka \
    --cloud google-europe-north1 \
    --plan startup-2 \
    -c kafka_rest=true \
    -c kafka.auto_create_topics_enable=true \
    -c schema_registry=true
```

> **Note** If you're using an existing account which has VPCs in the
> region you've chosen, then you also need to specify `--no-project-vpc`
> to guarantee that you don't use the VPC.

It takes a little while for a service to start up. You can wait for it
using:

``` shell
avn service wait $KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME
```

which will update you on the progress of the service, and exit when the
service is `RUNNING`.

### Download certificates

In order to let the demo programs talk to the Kafka service, you need to
download the appropriate certificate files. Create a directory to put
them into:

``` shell
mkdir certs
```

and then download them:

``` shell
avn service user-creds-download $KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME -d certs --username avnadmin
```

### Get the connection information

To connect to the Kafka service, you need its service URI. You can find
that out with:

``` shell
avn service get $KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME --format '{service_uri}'
```

It's useful to put that into an environment variable. With Bash, you can do:
```shell
export KAFKA_SERVICE_URI=$(avn service get $KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME --format '{service_uri}')
```

and if you're using the Fish shell (like me) that's
```shell
set -x KAFKA_SERVICE_URI (avn service get $KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME --format '{service_uri}')
```

## Exploring your service

To find out more information about a Kafka topic, look at the
documentation for [avn service
topic](https://docs.aiven.io/docs/tools/cli/service/topic.html).

You can also find useful information about a service using the [Aiven
web console](https://console.aiven.io/), on the **Services** page for
your Kafka service.

## Run a demo

*And now you're ready to run the demo programs*

In general, if you've put certificates into the `certs` directory, and set the
`KAFKA_SERVICE_URI` environment variable (and others we'll come to later),
then you can just run the demo programs with no arguments. For instance:

```shell
./demo1_cod_and_chips.py
```

You can get help with the `--help` switch.

If you want to be more explicit, you can also specify the Kafka service URI
with the `-k` switch, and the certificates directory with the `-c` switch.
For instance:

```shell
./demo1_cod_and_chips.py \
    -k tibs-kafka-fish-dev-sandbox.aivencloud.com:12693 \
    -d certs
```

or:
``` shell
./demo1_cod_and_chips.py -k $KAFKA_SERVICE_URI -d certs
```

## Log files

Each of the demo programs (the ones whose names start with `demo`) write logs
to a file called `demoN.log` - so `demo1_cod_and_chips.py` writes log messages
to `demo1.log` and so on.

The logs are useful for understanding what the program is actually doing, and
also for working out what is wrong if things fail. We use a log file because
writing the logs to the terminal would interfere with the terminal UI.

## After you're done

If you're not using your Kafka service for a while, and don't mind
losing any data in its event stream, then it makes sense to power it
off, as you don't get charged (real money or free trial credits) when a
service is powered off.

You can power off the service (remember, this will discard all your
data) with:

``` shell
avn service update $KAFKA_SERVICE --power-off
```

and bring it back again with:

``` shell
avn service update $KAFKA_SERVICE --power-on
```

This will take a little while to finish, so wait for it with:

``` shell
avn service wait KAFKA_FISH_DEMO
```

If you've entirely finished using the Kafka service, you can delete it
with:

``` shell
avn service terminate KAFKA_FISH_DEMO
```

## Future things to do

Homework projects suggested in the talk:

1.  Use a JDBC Kafka Connector to send orders from the main topic to a
    PostgreSQL速 database, and then add a widget to the demo that queries
    that database periodically and updates a panel with some summary
    information (perhaps as simple as the total count of cod, chip and
    plaice orders).
2.  Use a Redis速 cache to simulate the cook preparing food for the hot
    cabinet. There's a brief summary in the slides. For extra credit,
    also have the cook "wake up" periodically to check if they need to
    cook more cod or chips to keep the amount in the hot cabinet at the
    right level.

Let me know if you play with these ideas!

# Use a JDBC Kafka Connector

[`demo5_output_to_pg.py`](demo5_output_to_pg.py)

The only change to the source code (from that in
[`demo1_cod_and_chips.py`](demo1_cod_and_chips.py)) is to add JSON schema
information to our messages.

> **Note** If we were using Avro messages, we could use Karapace to "tell"
> both ends of the data process what schema was being used for messages, but
> the JSON mechanism doesn't currently support that.

* Aiven documentation: [Create a JDBC sink connector from Apache Kafka速 to
  another database](https://docs.aiven.io/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/jdbc-sink)
  
First create the PostgreSQL database (note: a free tier database will do, or a
hobbyist plan should be plenty).

Lets set the database name as an environment variable - in Bash that's:
```shell
export PG_SERVICE_NAME tibs-pg-fish
```
and in the Fish shell:
```shell
set -x PG_SERVICE_NAME tibs-pg-fish
```

Then create the service. It's sensible to put it into the same cloud/region as
the Kafka service - although if you're using a free PostgreSQL, that may not
be possible - luckily it's not critical for a demo like this.

```shell
avn service create $PG_SERVICE_NAME \
      --service-type pg \
      --cloud google-europe-north1 \
      --plan hobbyist
```

and again wait for it to finish starting up:
```shell
avn service wait $PG_SERVICE_NAME
```

Next we need to connect to the PostgreSQL database and set up a schema.

> **EDIT EDIT EDIT** Here we're using the `avn` command - does that need me to
> have installed `psql`? Should I talk about that?

```shell
avn service cli $PG_SERVICE_NAME
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE demo5_cod_and_chips (count int PRIMARY KEY, "order" jsonb);
```

> **Note** we [need to quote the column name `order` because it is also a
> PostgreSQL keyword](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7651417/escaping-keyword-like-column-names-in-postgres).

Since we're going to use a JDBC connector with our Kafka, that means using a
service integration (between Kafka and our PostrgreSQL database), and so we
need to upgrade our Kafka to a plan that will support service integrations,
like `business-4`, and then switch Kafka Connect on so we can use them.

```shell
avn service update $KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME \
      --plan business-4 \
      -c kafka_connect=true
```

and again wait for the service to finish updating itself:
```shell
avn service wait $KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME
```

We're now going to follow the instructions at
[Create a JDBC sink connector to PostgreSQL速 on a topic with a JSON schema](https://docs.aiven.io/docs/products/kafka/kafka-connect/howto/jdbc-sink#example-create-a-jdbc-sink-connector-to-postgresql-on-a-topic-with-a-json-schema)

We need the values for `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_SSL_MODE`,
`DB_USERNAME` and `DB_PASSWORD` from the Overview part of the PostgreSQL
service page, so we can create a file called `pg_sink.json`, using the
following as a template:
```json
{
    "name":"sink_fish_chips_json_schema",
    "connector.class": "io.aiven.connect.jdbc.JdbcSinkConnector",
    "topics": "demo5-cod-and-chips",
    "table.name.normalize": "true",
    "connection.url": "jdbc:postgresql://DB_HOST:DB_PORT/DB_NAME?sslmode=DB_SSL_MODE",
    "connection.user": "DB_USERNAME",
    "connection.password": "DB_PASSWORD",
    "tasks.max":"1",
    "auto.create": "false",
    "auto.evolve": "false",
    "insert.mode": "insert",
    "delete.enabled": "false",
    "pk.mode": "record_value",
    "pk.fields": "count",
    "value.converter": "org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter"
}
```
1. I've changed the connector `name` to something more appropriate.

2. The value for `topics` needs to match the topic name specified in
   [`demo5_output_to_pg.py`](demo5_output_to_pg.py) - that is,
   `demo5-cod-and-chips`.
   
3. By default, the table written to will have the same name as the topic.
   Since that includes `-` characters, we want to set `table.name.normalize`
   to `true`, which means the table name will be `demo5_cod_and_chips`

3. The value for `pk.fields` is `"count"`, and that together with the value
   for `pk.mode` says to use the `count` field from the message as its key.

4. We set `auto.create` for `false` because we have already created our target
   table, and don't need it creating for us. Similarly, we set `auto.evolve`
   to `false` because we don't want its schema to be changed for us.

5. We set `insert.mode` to `"insert"` because we should only be inserting new
   records. For PostgreSQL,
   [`upsert`](https://github.com/aiven/jdbc-connector-for-apache-kafka/blob/master/docs/sink-connector.md#upsert-mode)
   would do `INSERT .. ON CONFLICT .. DO UPDATE SET ..`, which will update a
   row if it already exists. In theory we don't want that, as each order shoud
   be unique. In practice, for a demo, this might actually be a problem, as
   restarting the demo program will restart `count` from 0 again. We'll see
   what happens in practice.

Now we should be able to create the connector:
``` shell
avn service connector create $KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME @pg_sink.json
```

> **Note** It's possible to specify the JSON at the command line, but
> generally easier to set it up correctly in a file with a text editor, and
> then use that.

## Debugging the sink connector

I'm trying to use a JSON structure with sub-structures, and it's quite
possible I'm not allowed to do that. So let's make things simpler, by
(temporarily) making our order structure into just:
```json
{ "count": <count>, "order": <count> }
```


```sql
create table demo5_cod_and_chips (count int PRIMARY KEY, "order" int);
```

`int32` in the JSON schema shoud map to `int` in PG - `integer` in the scheam is not recognised.

OK, let's try `auto.create` set to `true` and see what table it creates...

...and now I have:
```
defaultdb=> select * from demo5_cod_and_chips;
 count | order
-------+-------
     1 |     1
     2 |     2
     3 |     3
     4 |     4
     ...
```

which is a bit odd because that's the same table name I'd already created. Oh well.
I suppose it might be an artefact of all the retrying I've been doing - check
again when I'm re-running my "fixed" version of this from scratch.

I guess the next thing to try is whether using `jsonb` as the datatype in the
db table will work, if there is structure in the order (that is, going back to
the original JSON schema).

```sql
drop table demo5_cod_and_chips;
create table demo5_cod_and_chips (count int PRIMARY KEY, "order" jsonb);
```

If I then just run the demo program, the connector gets an exception that keys
(in the database?) already exist. But there's nothing in the table (by
inspection).

So restart Kafka again - maybe I need to do that anyway to "clear" stuff.

-----------


To get a list of the service connectors (as a JSON structure) attached to this Kafka, use:
```shell
avn service connector list $KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME
```

To find out more about the connector, go to the Aiven console and the service
page for our Kafka, and look at the **Connectors** tab. If there are errors,
then you'll see a warning triangle symbol next to the "Tasks" value for the
connector, and clicking on that will give the Java stacktrace.


```shell
avn service connector status $KAFKA_SERVICE_NAME <sink-name>
```
